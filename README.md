# Hexabins
HEXABINS USING PYTHON
This Python code uses Matplotlib to create a hexbin plot using randomly generated data. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np
   ```
   Imports the necessary libraries. Matplotlib is imported under the alias `plt`, and NumPy is imported as `np`.

2. **Generating Sample Data:**
   ```python
   x = np.random.normal(size=1000)
   y = np.random.normal(size=1000)
   ```
   Creates two arrays of random data using NumPy's `random.normal()` function. `x` and `y` both contain 1000 data points generated from a normal distribution.

3. **Creating the Hexbin Plot:**
   ```python
   plt.hexbin(x, y, gridsize=50, cmap='Greens')
   ```
   Generates a hexbin plot using the `hexbin()` function from Matplotlib. This function creates a two-dimensional histogram by binning the data into hexagonal areas. Parameters:
   - `x` and `y` are the input data arrays.
   - `gridsize=50` specifies the number of hexagons in the x-direction. Higher values create smaller hexagons.
   - `cmap='Greens'` sets the color map to 'Greens'. This defines the color scheme for the hexagons.

4. **Color Bar:**
   ```python
   plt.colorbar()
   ```
   Adds a color bar to the plot, indicating the mapping of colors to values.

5. **Displaying the Plot:**
   ```pyt
   plt.show()
   ```
   Displays the generated hexbin plot with the specified parameters and data.

The hexbin plot is a useful way to represent the distribution of points in a two-dimensional space, particularly when dealing with a large number of points, by binning and color-coding the density of points in hexagonal regions. The color intensity in each hexagon represents the number of points falling into that particular area, allowing for visualization of data density and patterns.
